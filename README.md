We had to do a wordle game for school so I looked up some Youtube videos.
This one is where I basically took the code from.

I kinda only shortened it, made the comments and the wordlist german and also put the wordlist directly in the class.
Yes, I know I am supposed to use multiple classes in Java, but since I can't really grasp this concept yet, I went with the original approach on the matter.
